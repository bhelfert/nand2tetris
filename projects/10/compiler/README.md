Modules/APIs implemented as specified in the book.

Only few checks, little error handling. Assumptions: Only valid data is passed; APIs are used correctly. 

Uses only JUnit and AssertJ, no libs like Commons Lang. 

Just hacked, make-it-work, try-it-out, PoC code. Simplistic. Don't reuse!

You have been warned.
