Modules/APIs implemented as specified in the book.

No checks, no error handling. Assumptions: Only valid data is passed; APIs are used correctly. 

Only integration tests.

Just hacked, make-it-work, try-it-out, PoC code. Simplistic. Bad style. Not refactored. Non-OO code. Don't reuse!

You have been warned.
