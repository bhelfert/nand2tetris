# About

These files are part of the wonderful learning experience provided by the course [From NAND to Tetris: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](http://www.nand2tetris.org/).

Kudos goes to all its [creators](http://www.nand2tetris.org/team.php) and especially to Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken for the idea and providing such a great course companion book, [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=ed_oe_p), MIT Press.

Of course, the implementation of the project tasks you will find here are not the creators' solutions, but only mine ;).
